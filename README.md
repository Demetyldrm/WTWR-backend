# 📖 About This Project : WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

I used Express and MongoDB to create this back-end project. Routes are used to forward the requests to the appropriate controller functions.Controller functions are used to get the requested data from the models. And finally, models are used to create schemas. I also used Postman for testing purposes.
