# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

I used Express and MongoDB to create this back-end project. I used Routes to forward the requests to the appropriate controller functions.Controller functions were used to get the requested data from the models .And finally, models were used to create schemas. I also used Postman for testing purposes.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
